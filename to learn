That’s a fantastic and focused goal — becoming a strong full-stack React + .NET developer with both modern and legacy system knowledge. Based on your project description and ambitions, I’ll craft you a progressive and practical study plan that builds:

Solid .NET Core skills

Strong React frontend experience

Production-grade patterns (SOLID, Clean Arch, DDD)

Awareness of legacy systems (WCF, .NET Framework)

DevOps, messaging (RabbitMQ), and real-time (SignalR)

🎯 Full-Stack .NET + React Developer Study Plan
📌 Phase 0 – Foundation Check (Optional Refresh)
Duration: 1 week (optional)
If you're already familiar with C#, JS, and basic Git, skip this.

Topics:
C# basics (classes, interfaces, async/await, LINQ)

JavaScript/ES6+ (let/const, arrow functions, promises, array methods)

Git & GitHub basics

HTTP & REST principles

📌 Phase 1 – Modern .NET Core (API, MVC, Auth)
Duration: 3–4 weeks

Goal: Build real-world RESTful APIs with modern .NET (6/7/8)
Learn:
.NET Core (Program.cs, Middleware, Dependency Injection)

Controllers, Routing, Attribute routing

Entity Framework Core (Code First, Migrations, LINQ)

Authentication with JWT & Authorization

appsettings.json, environment configs

Hands-on:
Build a Todo API, add user auth (JWT)

Deploy it locally using dotnet publish and host with Kestrel

🔁 Start getting familiar with dotnet CLI, not just Visual Studio

📌 Phase 2 – React Frontend (With TypeScript)
Duration: 3–4 weeks

Learn:
React fundamentals (hooks, state, props, router)

Fetching data from APIs (Axios or Fetch)

React with TypeScript (strongly recommended)

Form handling, validation (Formik + Yup)

Basic component design with Tailwind or MUI

Hands-on:
Connect to your .NET API from Phase 1

Build Todo UI: list, add, edit, delete

Add login flow (JWT → save token → protect routes)

📌 Phase 3 – Full-Stack Integration + Clean Architecture
Duration: 4 weeks

Learn:
Clean Architecture (layers: API → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)

SOLID principles

Dependency Inversion with interfaces

Automapper, MediatR (CQRS pattern)

Layered validation (FluentValidation)

Hands-on:
Refactor your API into Clean Architecture structure

Separate domain rules from data access and controllers

Implement CQRS using MediatR

📌 Phase 4 – Real-Time & Messaging
Duration: 3–4 weeks

Learn:
SignalR for real-time communication

RabbitMQ (or MassTransit) for asynchronous messaging

Pub/Sub vs Queueing

Event-driven architecture basics

Hands-on:
Add SignalR to a chat or notification module in your app

Set up RabbitMQ, publish an event when a new task is created, consume it for logging or side effects

📌 Phase 5 – Legacy .NET & Migration Readiness
Duration: 2–3 weeks

You mentioned .NET Framework 4.8 — knowing legacy tech helps in migration & maintenance

Learn:
WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)

How it worked (bindings, contracts)

Why it's being phased out

WebForms vs MVC (history)

IIS deep dive

web.config vs appsettings.json

Migration path to .NET Core (code analyzers, porting tools)

Optional Hands-on:
Build a small WCF service

Try porting it to minimal API

📌 Phase 6 – Microservices & Distributed Systems
Duration: 4 weeks

Learn:
Microservices principles vs SOA

DDD (Domain Driven Design) basics

API Gateway, BFF (Backend For Frontend)

Docker + Docker Compose

Basic Kubernetes

Service Discovery, Health Checks

Hands-on:
Split your app into 2 microservices (e.g. User Service + Task Service)

Communicate via REST or RabbitMQ

Run with Docker Compose

(Optional) Add Redis for caching

📌 Phase 7 – DevOps & Production-Readiness
Duration: 2–3 weeks

Learn:
Publishing .NET apps (self-contained, framework-dependent)

IIS / Nginx reverse proxy

Logging (Serilog, ELK basics)

Monitoring (Health Checks, Application Insights)

CI/CD (GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps)

Hands-on:
Publish your full-stack app

Deploy backend to IIS / Azure / DigitalOcean

Setup auto-deploy from GitHub

🧠 Bonus Topics (Optional)
Blazor (if you want a .NET-based frontend)

gRPC (modern alternative to WCF)

Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (beyond SQL Server)

IdentityServer (advanced auth)

Playwright or Cypress for testing
